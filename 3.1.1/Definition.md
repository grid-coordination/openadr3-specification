# Introduction

This document describes the third major iteration of the OpenADR protocol. It serves as a near functional equivalent of its predecessor, OpenADR 2.0b, but departs from the 2.0b SOAP-like web service design and instead adheres to RESTful web service best practices. REST services are much more common today than SOAP and are generally considered much more straightforward to use and troubleshoot. The main goal in providing this version as a complement to 2.0b is to lower the barriers of entry for new implementers and thereby encourage more widespread adoption of the standard.

This document contains normative and non-normative content and may contain simplifications for the purpose of conveying the underlying OpenADR REST concepts. Additional normative content can be found in the Normative References section, including the OpenADR 3 OpenAPI document. [OADR-3-Specification] which is the authoritative specification of the interface between VTN and clients.

## Revision 3.1.0 Introduction

Previous revisions (3.0, 3.0.1) supported a single mechanism (webhooks, via HTTP) for the Virtual Top Node (VTN) to push notifications to clients (resulting from Subscriptions), this revision adds support for additional notification event delivery protocols, with MQTT being the first such protocol defined.

# Terms and Definitions

OpenADR 3 adopts many terms from 2.0b directly, such as Event and Report. Terms that are new or modified are:

- **Program** - The business context for a given usage of the VTN. May be a Demand Response program, tariff, or other business construct.
- **ProgramName** - A unique name for a program or tariff. May be used by customers.
- **Program Description** - A human readable document provided out-of-band by a Business Logic entity that specifies a usage of the OpenADR 3 object model and configuration details such as VTN address, program names, applicable customer types, etc.
- **Tariff** - A type of program that defines the basic agreement between a retailer and a customer, such as an electricity pricing structure, as opposed to optional programs offered on top of a tariff.
- **Virtual Top Node (VTN)** - An application that implements the OpenADR 3 APIs. This is a Resource Server in REST parlance.
- **Virtual End Node (VEN)** - A software application that consumes events, generates reports, and directly or indirectly causes changes in energy consumption patterns. This is a client of a VTN.
- **Business Logic (BL)** - Application logic embodied in one or more software applications deployed by a utility, retailer, or other 'program owner' of the VTN that typically produces events and consumes reports. It may be incorporated into the VTN resource server such that the business logic application exposes the OpenADR 3 API. We use the term here to refer to a client of a VTN.
- **Customer Logic (CL)** - Application logic that requests and responds to program and event objects, produces reports, and may provide human facing features to support configuration and monitoring. May be incorporated into or interface with a VEN client.

## Notifier Terms and Defintions

- **Binding** - A specification (and implementation) of a protocol to support notifications of operations on OpenADR 3 objects.
Revision 3.1.0 specifies the binding to the MQTT protocol, and includes the original and existing webhook notifications as a notifier binding.
Future revisions may specify additional bindings, examples of possible future bindings include WebSockets and Kafka.

## Messaging Protocol Terms and Definitions

MQTT and Kafka are messaging protocols.

- **Broker** - The standard term for the "server" component of a messaging protocol system. VTNs implementing notifications via MQTT would include a MQTT broker.
- **Topic** - A category used to organize messages. Each topic has a name that is unique to the broker.
- **Client** - A client connects to a broker, in order to write or read messages.
- **Publisher/Producer** - A client that writes messages to a topic on a broker. VTNs implementing notifications via MQTT would be publishing clients
- **Subscriber/Consumer** - A client that reads messages from a topic on a broker. Typically the subscribing client will subscribe to a topic, and subsequently receive (read) messages published to that topic. VENs implementing notifications via MQTT would be subscribing clients.
- **Subscribe-able Object** - An OpenADR 3 object that can be subscribed to, resulting in subsequent notifications of changes to the subscribed object are sent to the subscriber. OpenADR 3 subscribe-able objects include: PROGRAM, EVENT, REPORT, SUBSCRIPTION, VEN, and RESOURCE.

# Overview

## System Architecture

REST systems are composed of a Resource Server exposing a set of HTTP APIs and multiple clients of the API. An OpenADR 3 VTN is a Resource Server, and like an OpenADR 2.0b VTN it provides a mechanism for business logic of a utility or other entity to transmit events and receive reports to and from an energy consuming client, known as a VEN.

OpenADR 3.0 defines a RESTful interface that is used by both business logic clients and customer logic clients, aka VENs, which represent flexible loads and other customer devices. In this model, an OpenADR 3.0 Resource Server (VTN) provides a mechanism for business logic and energy consumers to exchange events and reports. Figure 1 illustrates the canonical REST paradigm of server and clients, and how OpenADR terms are applied to these constructs.

![REST and its application to OpenADR](./img/defs-fig-1-rest-architecture.drawio.png "**Figure 1. REST and its application to OpenADR**")

Business Logic (BL) is application software hosted by an energy retailer that integrates to the retailers backend systems and interfaces with a VTN. It may also support an onboarding process, including a User Interface, by which VENs are provided security credentials and other configuration information (e.g. VTN URL).

Customer Logic (CL) uses a VEN client to obtain demand response events produced by BL and subsequently manage a set of 'resources' such as flexible loads and customer devices. CL may expose a User Interface to facilitate configuration and management of the VEN, e.g. configure VTN address.

An implementation of an OpenADR 3 system might incorporate Business Logic (BL) into a VTN, such that certain API features are not used by the BL and instead implementation specific mechanisms are used to support BL functions.

OpenADR 3.1.0 VTNs supporting notifications via MQTT will include a MQTT broker. VTN clients will make a (new) REST request to the VTN to determine the VTN's support for additional notification protocols, and for each notification supported, details of how to obtain notifications via that notification binding.  For VTNs supporting notifications via MQTT, the binding will include details of how the client can connect to the the VTN's MQTT broker.
The relationships between the VTNs REST API, MQTT broker, and potential clients are shown in Figure 1.5

![OpenADR data flow](./img/defs-fig-1-5-flow.drawio.png "Figure 1.5")

A tiered hierarchy of VTNs and VENs may also be supported, in which an entity acts as a VEN to interact with a VTN, and then presents its own VTN to 'downstream' VENs. This is shown in Figure 2.

<!-- ![OpenADR example implementation scenarios](./img/defs-fig-2-implementation-scenarios.png "Figure 2. OpenADR 3.0 example implementation scenarios") -->

![OpenADR example implementation scenarios](./img/oa-3-implementation-scenarios.png "Figure 2. OpenADR 3.0 example implementation scenarios")

## Local Scenarios

A common expected future usage of OpenADR will be for a central device in a utility-customer location to receive OpenADR events as a VEN,
then rebroadcast these - possibly modified - to local flexible loads and other devices.
The term 'local' here is applied to match IT usage as with a Local Area Network (LAN),
and this is different and distinct from 'locational' to refer to a geographic region, as with locational retail prices.
The central device might be a large building energy management system,
a home energy management system (HEMS) managing a collection of local devices,
or a microgrid controller.
Such a device is also then a VTN for other local devices.
This is an example of the use of a hierarchy of OpenADR links as in the right side of Figure 2.

There are several cases in which centralizing the reception of retail prices is beneficial.
Only one device needs to be aware of the identity of the retailer and tariff, so that if these change only one device needs to be updated.
Another case is when the customer wishes to incorporate the burden of greenhouse gas emissions into the optimization of loads and other devices, and do so with a 'local price';
the GHG value is multiplied by a \$/ton burden value and added to the retail price.
The localPrice boolean in a program description notifies downstream devices that the retail price has been modified.
Another use of a central device is to receive OpenADR signals over multiple communication channels for redundancy.
Yet another is for microgrid operation when the grid is down - the central device can be a microgrid controller and use OpenADR events, e.g. prices, to balance supply and demand.

It is not anticipated that the OpenADR standard needs to be modified in any way to fully support local operation, but any changes would be supplementary capabilities.

Note that the central device might also manage (some) local devices using protocols other than OpenADR, for example, Matter, BACnet, or Modbus.

### Discovery and Configuration of Local VTNs

The mDNS and DNS-SD protocols provide a convenient and standard method for a VEN within a customer site (e.g. a flexible load)
to automatically discover a VTN also within the site (e.g. a gateway).

A VEN intended for use within a customer site (a VEN that is not specifically intended to be used only in the cloud)
**SHOULD** support mDNS discovery of a local VTN.

A VTN intended for use within a customer site:

* **SHOULD** announce its `.local` hostname
* **SHOULD** advertise the service type `_openadr3._tcp.`
* **SHOULD** respond to PTR queries to the service type `_openadr3._tcp.` with:
  * A PTR record for the service instance name
  * A SRV record with the target hostname and port
  * A/AAAA records for the IP address(es)
  * TXT record metadata as follows:
    * `version` with value being the OpenADR3 version its supports, e.g. `3.1.0`
    * `base_path` whose value is whatever prefix is needed before the actual OA3 endpoint, e.g. `openadr3/3.1.0`
    * `local_url` with value `"https://{hostname).local:{port}/{base_path}"`
    * `program_names` with value being a comma separated string containing all `programNames` to be used by local VENs
	* `requires_auth` with values of `True` or `False`
    * `openapi_url` with value being a URL to the OpenAPI specification for the VTN

mDNS and DNS-SD support does not change the content of the OpenADR 3 standard; rather it occurs before any OpenADR communication occurs.

A VEN **SHOULD** favor use of the local VTN's `.local` hostname over its IP address, as dynamically assigned IP addresses (via DHCP) may change over time.

#### Example mDNS responses:

##### PTR Record – service type → service instance
```
_openadr3._tcp.local.      IN PTR My_VTN._openadr3._tcp.local.
```
This tells the client: There is a service instance named `My_VTN._openadr3._tcp.local` offering `_openadr3._tcp.`

##### SRV Record – service instance → hostname and port
```
My_VTN._openadr3._tcp.local.  IN SRV 0 0 883 myvtn.local.
```
This indicates the OpenADR3 service is at `myvtn.local`, port `883`. Priority and weight are both `0` here.

##### A Record – hostname → IPv4 address
```
myvtn.local.   IN A 192.168.1.42
```

##### AAAA Record – hostname → IPv6 address (if available)
```
myvtn.local.   IN AAAA fe80::abcd:1234:5678:90ef
```

##### TXT Record – service metadata
```
My_VTN._openadr3._tcp.local.  IN TXT version=3.1.0 \
      base_path=openadr3/3.1.0 \
      local_url=https://myvtn.local:883/openadr3/3.1.0 \
      program_names=local requires_auth=False
```

(Text wrapped for visual clarity.  It should be on one line.)

## VEN enrollment

OpenADR relies on an out-of-band process by which Business Logic provision VENs with information to allow VENs to obtain access tokens and make requests to the VTN.

A VEN **MUST** support end-user configuration of:

* VTN URL
* `clientID` and `clientSecret` (required for OAuth 2 client credential flow)

A VEN **MAY** be pre-configured with those (or other) items, but **MUST** support end-user reconfiguration.

Certain programs may further wish to provision application level information such as VEN names, resource names, targeting
labels, or other, but VENs are not required to support such configuration.
In such cases, VENs must integrate with BL systems to accomplish this.

A ‘tariff’ program may choose to configure a VTN to respond to requests from unauthenticated clients, but this behavior is outside the scope of the typical openADR 3 security model.
In such situations, only the VTN URL must be provisioned into the VEN.
See the section below “Security/Non-Authenticated Clients"

# General Usage

## Object Metadata

On object creation of programs, events, reports, subscriptions, vens,
and ven resources, client representations provided to the VTN on POST
requests are incomplete, as clients do not have the context to provide
accurate or meaningful values for the following attributes:

* objectID
* createdDataTime
* modificationDateTime
* objectType

A VTN SHALL populate object representations with the above fields on object creation.

## Required and optional properties

The specification is purposefully sparse of required fields so that clients may create and modify objects by creating requests with minimal effort.

If a representation sent to the VTN lacks a required property, a VTN SHALL return a 400, Bad Request response. A resource is not created or updated. Required fields do not have default values.

A representation provided in a write request (PUT, POST) to the VTN may
exclude optional fields. The VTN may create a corresponding object with
such excluded fields set to default values.

A VTN may provide representations of an object that do not include
optional properties that have their default value.

Optional fields are generally nullable and have default values of null,
where no assumption can be made on what reasonable a default value might
be.

If a representation includes a property that is not defined by an
object's schema, a VTN may create a corresponding resource without the
additional property, effectively ignoring the additional content.

## Response Codes and Errors

A VTN SHALL support the following standard codes:

```
GET
  200 - OK
  400 - Bad Request
  403 - Forbidden
  404 - Not Found
  500 - Internal Server Error

POST
  201 - Created
  400 - Bad Request
  403 - Forbidden
  404 - Not Found
  409 - Conflict (item already exists)
  500 - Internal Server Error

PUT
  200 - OK
  400 - Bad Request
  403 - Forbidden
  404 - Not Found
  409 - Conflict
  500 - Internal Server Error

DELETE
  200 - OK
  400 - Bad Request
  403 - Forbidden
  404 - Not Found
  500 - Internal Server Error
```

Servers may implement other response codes, but VENs might not recognize them.

### Problem

On 40x and 500 responses, a VTN SHALL respond with a *problem* object that contains details of the error. The problem object is intended to help clients determine what caused a particular response, such as Bad Request, Unauthorized, Forbidden, etc.

For example:

```json
{
  "title": "Not Found",
  "status": 404,
  "detail": "Unrecognized URL"
}
```

**Figure 3. Problem Example**

## POST and PUT

POST is used to create new objects, and PUT is used to update an
existing object. A VTN SHALL ignore objectID, createdDateTime,
modificationDateTime, and objectType values included in representations
used in POST and PUT requests.

## Compression

In some circumstances the size of responses should be minimized, such as
over bandwidth-constrained connections.

The HTTP protocol allows a client to request encoding using one of
several compression algorithms, such as GZIP, by using the
Accept-Encoding header. Server responses can then use the
Content-Encoding header to indicate the algorithm chosen, and the
response body is compressed accordingly. The result should be a seamless
exchange where data is compressed.

Configuring this behavior is outside the scope of the OpenAPI definition
of the OpenADR protocol. Instead, compression is implemented through
configuration of the HTTP/REST framework used for OpenADR clients and
servers.

Support for a given compression format is optional for VTNs, although
gzip is encouraged.

## Support for Strongly Typed languages

Certain OpenAPI construct, such as oneOf and anyOf are not suited to
code-generation of client or server stubs in strongly typed languages
like Java and C#. Code generators could operate if such constructs
explicitly included a super class with the alternative schemas modeled
as subclasses, but this is not implemented in OpenADR 3. Where OpenADR
3 uses oneOf and anyOf, classes should be manually created in some
languages.

## Message validation

A VTN SHALL reject request bodies that do not contain required fields.
Content that is not described by a message schema MAY be ignored. (See
Section 9.1 Model Extension). Validation of content by a VTN is
outside the scope of this specification and is considered an
implementation detail.

Content validation is the responsibility of clients and therefore
outside the scope of this specification.

## Subscriptions

OpenADR 3 supports both pull and push interactions. Pull interactions
are initiated by a client and are implemented with HTTP GET, POST, PUT,
and DELETE.

Push interactions are implemented with Subscriptions via webhooks. These
allow a client to be notified when certain operations transpire. A
webhook is a client endpoint registered with the VTN. When a specified
operation occurs, for example when an event is created, a request to the
client endpoint may be made by the VTN, thus notifying the client of the
new event.

Webhooks are implemented using subscription objects. A client creates a
new subscription object, which contains the webhook callback URL, and a
description of the objects and operations that will trigger a request to
the callback URL.

Subscription objects may contain targets, which are used by the VTN to filter
the notifications to the client in the same manner as targets are used in
response filtering.

`POST subscription`

```json
{
  "clientName": "myClient",
  "programID": "44",
  "objectOperations": [{
    "callbackUrl": "https://myserver.com/callbacks",
    "operations": [
      "CREATE",
      "UPDATE"
    ],
    "objects": [
      "EVENT",
      "PROGRAM"
    ]
  }]
}
```

**Figure 4. Subscription**

A subscription object is associated with a specific client and optionally a specific
program. The objectOperations list specifies what operations on which
resource types the client requests to be notified about.

A client may provide multiple resourceOperation entries to provide
different callbackUrls to catch notifications of different resources and
operations.

`POST subscription`

```json
{
  "clientName": "myClient",
  "programID": "44",
  "objectOperations": [
    {
      "callbackUrl": "https://myserver.com/event_callbacks",
      "operations": [
        "CREATE",
        "UPDATE"
      ],
      "objects": [
        "EVENT"
      ]
    },
    {
      "callbackUrl": "https://myserver.com/program_callbacks",
      "operations": [
        "CREATE",
        "UPDATE"
      ],
      "objects": [
        "PROGRAM"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Figure 5. multiple callback Subscription**

A VTN SHALL make a request to the callback URL when the conditions are
met per the objectOperations registered subscriptions. The callback
request body is a Notifications object that indicates the object type of
the resource, the operation that provoked the request, and the relevant
resource object.

`Notification`

```json
{
  "objectType": "PROGRAM",
  "operation": "POST",
  "object": {
    "bindingEvents": false,
    "createdDateTime": "2023-06-15T15:51:29.000Z",
    "id": "0",
    "localPrice": false,
    "objectType": "PROGRAM",
    "programName": "myProgram"
  }
}
```

**Figure 6. Notification Example**

## Notifications via Additional Protocols

As an alternative to object Subscriptions via REST and resulting
Notifications via webhooks, revision 3.1.0 defines a mechanism for a VTN to provide notifications via other protocols,
initially MQTT is the only defined alternate protocol.

A client may request information about supported notifications protocols
via the GET /notifiers request:

`GET /notifiers`

```json
{
  "MQTT": {
    "URIS": [
      "mqtts://broker.vtn.company.com"
    ],
    "authentication": {
      "method": "ANONYMOUS"
    },
    "serialization": "JSON"
  },
  "WEBHOOK": true
}
```

The example response above details that the VTN supports the `WEBHOOK` and `MQTT` notifiers.

The binding for the `MQTT` notifier provides a list of `URIS` for the VTN's MQTT broker, the authentication method required by the broker, and the message serialization, `JSON`.


**Figure 7. GET / notifiers Example**

The client may then connect to the VTN's MQTT broker with the information provided in the MQTT binding specification above.
The client can request the topic names for OpenADR objects and operations upon them.
The topic name request endpoints include:

- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/programs`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/programs/{programID}`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/events`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/programs/{programID}/events`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/reports`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/subscriptions`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/vens`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/vens/{venID}`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/resources`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/vens/{venID}/events`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/vens/{venID}/programs`
- `GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/vens/{venID}/resources`

An example request and response for the MQTT topic names for operations on all programs on the VTN:

`GET /notifiers/mqtt/topics/programs`

```json
{
  "topics": {
	"ALL": "programs/+",
	"CREATE": "programs/create",
	"DELETE": "programs/delete",
	"UPDATE": "programs/update"
    }
}
```

The response from the VTN is a JSON object, containing the key `topics`, and the value is a JSON object, each key being the operation on the object, and the value of that key is the topic-name for that operation.

Unlike the Subscriptions REST request, response filtering (see section
6.9 below) is not supported for topic subscriptions made via messaging
protocols. If a client subscribes to an object's operations, it will
receive all such notifications, and it is the responsibility of the
client to ignore/filter events to which it is not interested.

The format and content of the notification messages received by clients
will be the same as the existing notification JSON response format
specified in OpenADR 3 (which is also the same as what is returned
when the message is obtained via an OpenADR 3 REST GET request).

## Response Filtering

A VTN may support large numbers of objects, such as vens and associated
resources. In order to reduce potentially large responses that might
include object representations of no interest to a client, clients may
provide query params to allow a VTN to filter results.

For example, when requesting a list of reports, a client may specify,
through query params, that only reports associated with a specific
program, and/or created by a specific client, be included in a response.

Targeting criteria can be used to filter responses to include only those
objects that include target terms found in the query. See the Object Privacy 
section below for details on how targeting may be use to enhance object privacy.

VTN SHALL support limit and skip query params on GET operations, as
described by [OADR-3-Specification], to control pagination of
potentially large responses.

VTN SHALL treat filtering params as additive, that is, results must
match every filter term.

Future versions of OpenADR3 may provide other features that facilitate
massive scalability or operation under extremely bandwidth or memory
constrained environments.

## Object names

Some objects have name attributes that can be used as query parameters
to retrieve them. This requires uniqueness with given scopes.

* `program.programName` - must be unique to a VTN instance.
* `ven.venName` - must be unique within the scope of a VTN instance.
* `ven.resource.resourceName` - must be unique to its associated ven.

Event and report names are not required to be unique.

## Object Privacy
An important aspect of security is preventing unintended access to objects. BL clients are given carte blanche access to all
objects, but VEN clients are limited to accessing those objects they have themselves created or for which they have been granted access.

ven, resource, report, and susbcription objects may be created by VENs and it is assumed these are intended to be read by BL and no other VENs.
BL may also create ven and resource objects and similarly limit visibility to intended VENs. Finally, BL may create
program and event objects intended for one or a set of VENs via targeting.

### VEN created object privacy
When a VEN creates a ven, subscription, or report object the VTN SHALL discover a VEN's client identifier associated with the request's token and write the identifier into
the object.clientID field (not unlike how VTN writes object metadata on creation).
The means by which the VTN discovers a client identifier associated with the token is not specified here.
Strategies may include using JWT tokens and extracting the clientID from the token or maintaining an association between a token and client identifier in a database.

On read, update or delete requests to /vens, /resources, /subscriptions or /reports by a VEN, the VTN SHALL discover the client identifier associated with the requestor's 
token and return the list of objects with matching clientID. 
If none exist, an empty set is returned. 

BL has unrestricted read access to all objects.

### BL created object privacy
#### ven objects
When BL creates a ven object it is expected to provide the clientID in the request body. BL may subsequently create resource objects associated with an existing ven object.

#### program and event objects - targeting
Targeting is used to enforce program and event object privacy. BL may append targets to program and event objects
to ensure these objects are only accessible to VENs that include those targets in their associated ven or resource objects. 

Targeting is a multi-step process: first, a ven object and optionally a number of resource objects,
must exist that BL has created or modified to 'grant' targets to a given VEN. Second, 
program and event objects are created that contain targets. When a VEN makes a read request for programs or events the VTN ensures that the requested targets have been granted to the requesting VEN.

On receipt of a VEN request to read a program or event object that has targets, a VTN SHALL
discover the requestor's clientID via token inspection (described above in VEN created object privacy), use this value to find a corresponding ven object, 
and perform a logical AND of the targets in the request and of the ven object and associated resource objects, and use the resulting set to perform target matching on the object. 
If no ven object exists with the requestor's clientID, if the intersection of request targets and ven targets is empty, or if the request targets do not 
match with the objects targets, an empty set is returned. 

When evaluating whether to send a notification of a change of state of an object with targets, the VTN SHALL use the clientID of 
a subscription object to discover the associated ven and resource objects, and process the targets as described above. 

This mechanism provides token-based assurance that the program or event object
is accessible only to those clients that have specifically been 'granted' targets (via the ven object) and
include those or a subset of targets in a request.

Additional requirements to support targeting are:
* Target hiding: For program and event objects, a VTN will only include requested targets in a response. This prevents VENs from learning targets that have
not been explicitly assigned to them by BL. Target hiding is not performed on ven, resource, or subscription objects as these objects are read-able only by a specific VEN.
* Only BL clients may write targets to ven and resource objects, because of the interdependency between program and event targets and
the targets 'granted' to a VEN.
* VENs are assigned a default security scope of 'read_targets' that indicates to a VTN that read operations by a VEN for an object that has targets must include matching targets in the query.

# Information Model

An Information Model is a conceptual representation of entities and
relationships to facilitate human communication; to be useful for
machines it is translated to a data model. [OADR-3-Specification] is
a machine-readable YAML file providing the authoritative description of
the protocol, including schema components that define a concrete
representation of the Information Model. While the YAML is
human-readable, the description here is provided as an easier to digest
summary of the main data objects defined in the Specification.

The specification document does not describe all aspects of the meaning
of the data elements below. Considerable detail on this is in the User
Guide [OADR-3-User_Guide]. Examples of detail found there are for
payload descriptors, events, reports, interval timing, data quality, and
targeting.

IDs for programs, events, and reports are created by the VTN when these
objects are posted, and all such IDs are unique within the VTN. Other
identifiers are created out-of-band of OpenADR such as clientID in
report or created by the entity creating the object such as ID in
interval.

Objects that are addressable through the API, i.e. can be accessed via
`<url>/path/{objectID}`, contain an ID attribute that is of type
objectID, and creation and modification timestamps. These attributes are
populated by the VTN on object creation and modification.

In the listing below, any default value is listed in brackets after the
definition.

# EndPoints

A REST API provides URLs that clients use to perform CRUD operations on
'resources'; this is a URL path but usually called an 'endpoint'. Object
instances of the items described by the Information Model above are
'resources', and CRUD operations are Create, Read, Update, and Destroy,
implemented by the HTTP verbs POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. There is
copious free information on the web regarding REST APIs. One good
example for background is [REST_Best_Practice].

The YAML document [OADR-3-Specification] provides the authoritative
and complete definition of the endpoint​​ and operations supported by the
profile. For programs and events, only the BL will do POST, PUT, and
DELETE operations. Only VENs will POST and PUT reports and
subscriptions.

POST is used to create new objects, and PUT is used to update an
existing object. objectID and createdDateTime values included in
representations used in POST and PUT requests will be ignored by the VTN
server.

The text below is a heavily subsetted version of the specification that
summarizes only the essential information for human readability. The
term 'security' below indicates the scopes necessary to perform the
associated operation. Scopes are discussed elsewhere.

The security terms below (e.g. "security: [read_all]") indicate the
access permissions required to perform an operation. From the
specification:

# Revision

REST APIs may be designed to be revised and preserve backwards
compatibility. Typically, the base URL will contain a version number,
e.g. `https://myAPI/1.0/`, with 1.0
as a version number. A revision to the API can be given a new version
number and hosted at a new base URL, e.g
`https://myAPI/1.1/`. A VTN could offer both versions concurrently, allowing older clients to interoperate
with the older version while upgrading to the new version at a time of
their choosing. Typically, an older version will be deprecated after
some period of time. While there is currently no plan to revise OpenADR
3, doing so with this mechanism would be easy to implement.

Versioning will follow Semantic Versioning \[SEMVER\] guidelines where a
version number is of the form major.minor.patch and each may be
incremented as follows:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

# Extensibility

The OpenADR 3 protocol allows servers and clients to interoperate
without custom integration. It is intended to provide a functional
footprint that is sufficient to accommodate all common demand response
use cases. However, some demand response program developers may find it
useful to use content that cannot be expressed using the constructs of
the specification, or could be expressed in a better form with an
extension.

There are two extension mechanisms offered by OpenADR 3: model
extensions, and private strings.

## Model Extension

A VTN and clients might agree to private model extensions by adding
constructs to the standard models. VTNs that are ignorant of such
private extensions may simply ignore such content and underlying
functionality that represents such private extensions.

The example in Figure 3 shows an event object with a non-standardized
attribute called myPrivateObject. This attribute may be ignored by VTNs
that do not recognize it.

```json
{
  "ID": 1,
  "createdDateTime": "2023-06-15T09:12:28.000Z",
  "myPrivateObject": "whatever I want",
  \....\
}
```

**Figure 7. Example Event object**

## Private Strings

The standard provides enumerated values for a number of object fields.
These enumerations have defined semantics. A VTN and clients may agree
on additional values that can be supplied in these fields.

The example below shows a report payload object with the
non-standardized string PRIVATE_ALGORITHM. VTNs do not process attribute
values, so the use of non-standard strings does not affect the behavior
of the VTN but both Business Logic and VEN clients may process their
agreed upon strings.

```json
"payloads": [
{
  "type": "PRIVATE_ALGORITHM",
  "values": [0.17]
},
```

**Figure 8. Example Private String**

# Enumerations

## Introduction

A critical feature of OpenADR is the use of enumerations that provide
context to payload values. For example, a payload value of '0.17' is
associated with context in order for a client to know that it is a
price, or percent, or other type of data. OpenADR 3 uses enumerated
strings to provide context to data. These strings enable BL and VENs to
interoperate. Note that payload values are always an array and so
enclosed in brackets ("\[\...\]") even if just a single value.

VENs that support standard enumerations should interoperate with BL that
generates events with those values, and conversely generate reports that
can be consumed by BL that support them. A program may define its own
strings and work with VEN partners as they implement the appropriate
logic (see Private Extensions in \[OADR-3-User_Guide\]).

OpenADR 3 defines enumerations for those use cases that are well
described, are in use today, and/or are plausible for use in the near
future. Notes in definitions are not part of the formal definition but
include useful information and context.

The term "enumeration\" is used in its common form as simply indicating
lists, and not in the computer science sense of mapping numbers to
names. There is no utility in OpenADR to assign numeric values to the
strings defined here as enumerations.

## Event Payload Enumerations

The following defined names and types inform a VEN on how to interpret
values in an event interval payload. The enumerations may be assigned to
the payloadType attribute of a payload included in an interval included
in an event and in an associated payloadDescriptor in the Event or
Program. For example:

```json
{
  ...
  "payloadDescriptors": [
    {
      "payloadType": "PRICE",
      "units": "KWH",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ],
  "intervals": [
    {
      ...
      "payloads": [
      {
        "type": "PRICE",
        "values": [0.17]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Reading Type Enumerations

These labels are qualifiers to report name labels, to indicate the nature of the reported value. DIRECT_READ is the default, if the qualifier is absent. Note that these apply to the data source in general, not to specific intervals.

Reading types are used in `payloadDescriptor` objects to provide context to associated payloads. For example, reading type usage in a `payloadDescriptor`:

```json
{
  "payloadType": "USAGE",
  "readingType": "DIRECT_READ",
  "units": "KWH"
}
```

Reading type usage in a `valuesMap`:

```json
{
  "type": "USAGE",
  "values": [ 0.17 ]
}
```

**Figure 11. Example Reading Types as used in reportPayloadDescriptor and in report payload**

<!--
This enumeration table is a simple "enum".
Therefore we don't have a JSON table to read
where there is a KEY and DESCRIPTION as two fields
of an array of objects.

<--schema-descriptions id="reading-types-enumeration" schemahref="/home/david/Projects/openadr/openapi-3.0.0/enumerations/reading-types.schema.yaml"></schema-descriptions
-->

Table: Table 3. Reading Type Enumerations

| **Reading type** | **Definition** |
-------------------|----------------|
| DIRECT_READ      | Payload values have been determined by direct measurement from a resource. |
| ESTIMATED        | Payload value is an estimate where no Direct Read was available for the interval, but sufficient other data exist to make a reasonable estimate. |
| SUMMED           | Payload value is the sum of multiple data sources. |
| MEAN             | Payload value represents the mean measurements over an interval. |
| PEAK             | Payload value represents the highest measurement over an interval. |
| FORECAST         | Payload value is a forecast of future values, not a measurement or estimate of actual data. |
| AVERAGE          | Payload value represents the average of measurements over an interval. |


## Operating State Enumerations

These definitions characterize the operating state of a resource under control of a VEN.

<!-- As with Reading Type, this is a simple enumeration
and if there were a schema file it would not
be useful for constructing this table. -->

Table: Table 4. Operating State Enumerations

| **Operating State** |  **Definition** |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| NORMAL              | Resource is operating normally. No Demand Response directives are currently being followed. |
| ERROR               | Resource has self-reported an error or is not addressable by VEN. |
| IDLE_NORMAL         | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that no demand response event is in effect and the SGD has no/insignificant energy consumption." |
| RUNNING_NORMAL      | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that no demand response event is in effect and the SGD has significant energy consumption." |
| RUNNING_CURTAILED   | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that a curtailment type demand response event is in effect and the SGD has significant energy consumption." |
| RUNNING_HEIGHTENED  | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that a heightened-operation type of demand response event is in effect and the SGD has significant energy consumption." |
| IDLE_CURTAILED      | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that a curtailment type demand response event is in effect and the SGD has no/insignificant energy consumption." |
| SGD_ERROR_CONDITION | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that the SGD is not operating because it needs maintenance support or is in some way disabled (i.e. no response to the grid)." |
| IDLE_HEIGHTENED     | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that a heightened-operation type of demand response event is in effect and the SGD has no/insignificant energy consumption." |
| IDLE_OPTED_OUT      | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that the SGD is presently opted out of any demand response events and the SGD has no/insignificant energy consumption." |
| RUNNING_OPTED_OUT   | CTA-2045 device "Indicates that the SGD is presently opted out of any demand response events and the SGD has significant energy consumption." |

## ResourceName Enumerations

Table 5. `resourceName` Enumeration

| **Label**            | **Description**  |
|--------------|------------------|
| AGGREGATED_REPORT   | A report contains a list of resources, each of which may contain a list of intervals containing reporting data. Each item in the resource list contains a resourceName attribute. This resourceName indicates the interval data is the aggregate of data from more than one resource. |


## Data Quality Enumerations

These can be used to qualify report payloads, to indicate the status of individual interval values. These are values that may be used in payloads of type DATA_QUALITY.

```json
{
  ...
  "intervals": [
    {
      "payloads": [
        {
          "type": "USAGE",
          "values": [ 0 ]
        },
        {
          "type": "DATA_QUALITY",
          "values": [ "MISSING" ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Figure 12. Example Data Quality as used in a Report**

# Security

Security in OpenADR addresses the Authentication and Authorization of client requests to the VTN server. Common REST API best practices are followed, and the Oauth2 client credential flow describes the mechanism to secure the API.

## Security objectives

The overall approach to security in OpenADR 3 is based on the following three pillars.

- **Authentication.** A client request is Authenticated with a VTN in order to access resources[^1]. REST servers are 'stateless' and do not maintain session state, therefore every API request must contain some token or credential to allow the VTN server to authenticate the identity of the requestor.
- **Authorization.** Within the context of a given program, a VEN will be authorized to access some set of resources and associated operations. The VTN server will limit access to resources and associated operations to those authorized to a requestor, based on the identity of the requestor. See Authentication above.
- **Common (well known and widely implemented) Security Model**. OADR REST adopts common industry approaches to Authentication and Authorization. [REST-API-Best_Practices]


[^1]: Note that VTNs may provide some endpoints with no access restrictions for freely available information such as prices for common tariffs.

## Assumptions

The following specific assumptions underlie the OpenADR 3 security model.

- VTN security must meet stringent requirements. Client requests must be able to be authenticated and access to API resources and operations must be able to be authorized.
  - VTNs are software applications that do not directly interface with any element of the grid. As an information service provided by a utility retailer, the VTN provides APIs to allow the retailer to 'publish' information it deems appropriate to share with customers and other interested parties. There is no mechanism by which a VTN (if restricted to implement only its function as a resource server) or its clients may interact with other components of a utility\'s systems.
- VTN clients include utility Business Logic and VENs; therefore a security solution must work for both scenarios.
  - Client requests must be associated with a client role, and roles define what operations on what API objects a given client may perform. For example, a Business Logic client may create an event, but a VEN cannot. Both can read an event, but a VEN can only read events associated with the programs it is entitled to access.
- VENs may be implemented within on-site customer devices such as a water heater, external hardware controllers, or a central device. VENs may also be implemented in servers in the cloud.
  - This implies that certifying devices and provisioning x.509 certs or other PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) as detailed in OpenADR 2.0b is daunting at best, or simply not supportable.
  - A REST API requires some form of application level credential exchange to authenticate and authorize client requests. Even where PKI may be required, it is not sufficient to address access control of API objects.
- Devices (OpenADR 'resources') represented by VENs are owned by a utility customer, who has a customer account with the utility.
  - A utility may require that for a customer to participate in a DR program they enroll their account in the program, and may need to register their 'resources' or devices into the program.
- VENs must be manually provisioned with a VTN address that has been provided by the utility retailer.
  - This implies that there is no plug-n-play scenario in which a customer owned device simply begins to participate in a conventional demand response program without some manual configuration. Therefore, the device should present a web UI or other interface to a customer. (Much like a home router presents a web app at a known address).
  - A typical means to acquire a VTN address would be for a customer to login in to their utility account and obtain the address as part of the enrollment and registration flow described in the bullet above.
  - Methods to automate and standardize this are under consideration by the OpenADR Alliance but separate from the OpenADR 3 standard itself. This could be particularly applicable for automated discovery of price servers with only the identity of a retailer or tariff, or completely automated discovery of a price server local to a customer site.
- Business Logic and VEN clients must be provisioned with client secrets or other credentials prior to accessing a VTN.

## Client Scenarios

The choice of security protocol(s) depends in part on what client scenarios are anticipated.

A protocol that is difficult and error prone for end users to support represents a security threat in itself; it is anticipated that humans may be engaged in creating accounts, obtaining credentials and tokens, and so on. What can be supported by the average customer is less complex than what IT professionals could support.

OpenADR 2.0b relies on x509 certificates provisioned into the OS of VTNs and VENs. This is most appropriate for commercial server to server communications, as acquiring, provisioning, and maintaining such certs is generally considered overly complex for use in consumer owned devices. X509 certs may also be useful in scenarios where a consumer device has factory installed certs.

VEN client platforms include:

- Cloud-based applications managed by IT professionals, e.g. a DER aggregator, product manufacturer, or other cloud-based service provider. Public cloud environments do not lend themselves to device-level authentication as per x.509 as installing and managing such certs is impractical.
- Commercial servers on site managed by IT professionals, e.g. a building or energy management system, or even a device as simple as a Wi-Fi access point.
- External control device for a single customer device such as a gateway device of some sort. Such environments do not lend themselves to device-level authentication as per x.509 as installing and managing such certs is impractical.
- Appliance or other customer device such as a water heater, refrigerator, in-home battery, or EV. These may be provisioned with security certificates or otherwise configured before installation at a customer site, or provisioned remotely by an IT professional.

Note that a VEN may directly control a device, may translate grid signals into device control signals that it passes on,
or may pass along grid signals with a subsidiary VTN/VEN relationship or via another in-building protocol (e.g. Matter, Modbus, BacNET etc).

## Non-Authenticating VTNs

A VTN that provides only public information may choose to support unauthenticated OpenADR 3 requests, by responding to all incoming requests, without the specified OAuth2 access token.
This provision allows programs to offer public information, such as public pricing schedules to any software client that makes a request.

A non-authenticating VTN would provide the VTN's URL to VENs, for out-of-band configuration, with no `clientID`/`clientSecret`.
A VEN configured with a VTN URL and no `clientID`/`clientSecret` **SHOULD** proceed to make requests to the OpenADR 3 REST API without obtaining a OAuth2 token.

## HTTPS/TLS

A VTN or VEN **MUST**  use ‘HTTP over TLS’ (HTTPS), regardless of its intended operating environment.

A VEN **SHOULD** default to verifying the VTN's TLS certificate, and if unverified, refuse to connect with VTN, and indicate that (somehow) to the VEN's admin.

A VEN **SHOULD** support a configuration setting to allow unverified TLS connections.

The TLS version used **MUST** be `1.2` (or later).

A VTN **SHOULD** use TLS certificates that are verifiable via well-known Certificate Authorities, (e.g. DigiCert or Let's Encrypt).

A VTN implementation designed for use only within a private network **MAY** use self-signed certificates,
at the risk that (local) VENs will be unable to verify the VTN's self-signed certificate.
Methods to enable enable local VENs to work with a local VTN's self-signed certificate include:

* Configure local VENs to allow unverified certificates.
* Configure local VENs with the VTN's CA certificate via some out-of-band proceedure

It is the responsibility of a VTN service provider to maintain a secure platform, including updating TLS ciphers when appropriate.

## MQTT

MQTT brokers and clients **MUST** support MQTT version 3.1.1 (or later).

MQTT brokers and clients **SHOULD** support MQTT version 5.0 (or later).

MQTT clients **MUST** use MQTT over TLS (MQTTS) to connect to the VTN's MQTT broker.

A VTN **MUST** configure, and enforce, access to the MQTT broker’s topics in accordance with its security and access policy which should be consistent with the security policy defined in the OpenAPI, “by any means necessary” (e.g. via the broker’s authorization API, if any), and this is out-of-band with respect to OpenADR 3 itself.

## API Gateway

A production VTN might deploy with an API gateway to implement rate limiting and perhaps other features. Rate limiting blocks requests after a certain number within a given time period from a given IP address, thus mitigating Denial of Service attacks.

## OAuth 2.0 client credential flow

Certified VEN clients must implement the OAuth2 [OAuth] client credential flow in which an out of band (from the REST interactions) process provides a clientID and secret to the VEN and associates the VEN with a role and associated Access Controls in the VTN. At runtime the VEN trades the clientID/secret for a short-lived token, which the VTN uses to Authenticate the client, and therefore Authorize access to certain resources. The VTN uses the token to determine which programs or tariffs may be accessed by the VEN.

OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow [Oauth2 Client Flow] is designed to help facilitate Authentication & Authorization for a Machine To Machine application. While OAuth itself does not specify the format of the Access Token, the most common format used is a JSON Web Token (JWT [JWT]) and this is advantageous for use in OpenADR 3.

The Authentication / Authorization process is as follows:

- A client is provided a client ID and secret via an out-of-band process. In the case of a VEN, a utility customer may engage with their energy retailer via web flow or other process to obtain these values, and then provision the VEN with them.
- The client makes a call to an Authorization server with a `ClientId` and `ClientSecret`.
- The client receives a short-lived API access token.
- The VEN client then makes a request to VTN API resource with the access token (in header "`Authorization: Bearer <token>`")
- The VTN verifies the token and returns an Unauthorized response if invalid or expired.
- The VTN determines the client role from the API token and applies fine-grained access control. For example, a VEN client not being allowed to create event objects.

The following is a simplified view of the client credential flow for VENs. This does not include details such as coordinating the Authentication server with Business Logic web flow to share client IDs and secrets or illustrate a similar process for Business Logic clients of VTN. [Client Flow Overview]

<!-- ![OAuth2 client credential flow](./img/defs-fig-16-oath-client-credential-flow.png "Figure 16: OAuth2 client credential flow") -->

![OAuth2 client credential flow](./img/oauth-2-client-credential-flow.png "Figure 16: OAuth2 client credential flow")

**Figure 16: OAuth2 client credential flow**

## OpenAPI Specification

OpenADR 3 is defined by an OpenAPI (aka swaggerdoc) YAML file. The OpenAPI platform provides mechanisms to define security objects and use them to assign scopes to operations \[OpenAPI Auth\]. In this manner the specification defines which clients can perform which operations on which objects. For example, Business logic clients can create events, but VENs cannot.

Each endpoint operation definition includes a security attribute, with a child attribute of `oAuth2ClientCredentials` that specifies what permissions are required for the operation. For example,

```yaml
  /programs:
    # ...
    get:
      # ...
      security:
        - oAuth2ClientCredentials: [read_all]
```

The `'read_all'` scope is defined in the `oAuth2ClientCredentials.securitySchemes` section of the OpenAPI document, as are other scopes.

## Token endpoint discovery

The OpenADR3 API includes two endpoints that help clients discover the token endpoint: the URL that will allow them to exchange client credentials for an authorization token.

  1. `/auth/server` is a required endpoint that returns information about the authentication and authorization service including the URL of the token endpoint.
  1. `/auth/token` is an optional endpoint that may act as the token endpoint.

VTN deployments may choose different mechanisms to provision tokens to VENs, including:

  - a VTN MAY integrate with an internal authentication service and providing tokens via the `/auth/token` endpoint.
    In this scenario, the `/auth/server` endpoint returns the `/auth/token` as the token endpoint URL.

    Since using `/auth/token` as the OAuth2 token endpoint involves sending client credentials to the OpenADR3 server, the client should ensure that the OpenADR3 server cannot use those credentials to impersonate the client for non-OpenADR3-related purposes.
    For more information, see the [OAuth2 Threat Model].

  - a VTN MAY use `/auth/server` endpoint to expose the location of an external authentication service.
    In this scenario, `/auth/token` MAY be excluded from the implementation or provide an implementation-defined informative response, such as
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented
    "This endpoint is not supported. Please use `/auth/server` \
    to look up the authentication server."
    ```

  - a VTN MAY expect that VENs have been provisioned out of band with the location of the authentication service by "mutual agreement" of the VTN provider and participating VENs.
    In this scenario, VTNs MUST still implement at least `/auth/server`, and MAY implement `/auth/token` at their discretion.

## Bearer tokens

A VTN is responsible for issuing bearer tokens, and it is an implementation detail what format to use, what features are encoded in the token, and how the token is used at runtime besides the role-based operation access control described above.

For example, a token may encode and be used to filter the events a VEN can read to only those associated with certain programs.

## Webhooks

When working with webhooks there are multiple potential security concerns, such as infiltrating and probing the VTN internal network (SSRF)[^2], etc. These can arise on the sender end (the VTN). On the receiver end (the VEN), the client needs to verify that the data coming into their webhook endpoint (the endpoint that accepts webhook notifications) is actually from the correct application, the VTN, and has not been spoofed/corrupted in transit.

[^2]: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery

To strengthen the webhooks security, the following requirements are to be met:

- The VEN client MUST use HTTPS for the webhook callback URL. The VTN MUST validate that an HTTPS schema is used for the callback URL of the webhook subscription that is created and/or updated.
- The VTN MUST verify the webhook callback URL is active and belongs to the requestor. To achieve this, the VTN MUST send a GET request to the provided callback URL that includes a challenge, a query string parameter named \'echo\', with random generated string value. When the VEN receives this request on the callback URL, it MUST respond with 200 OK response and include the query string parameter value in the body of the response. The VTN MUST verify that the echo parameter value that was sent back is the same as the one that was initially sent. In case when the validation fails, the VTN MUST NOT allow creation of the subscription.

### Additional guidelines

Following are a few guidelines that can be taken into consideration in relation with the webhooks in order to ensure even better security and reliability.

- *Configure timeouts*. The VTN should configure a timeout when making requests to the VEN client as a webhook consumer. The nature of webhooks suggests that they execute relatively quickly, therefore it is recommended that a VTN configure a timeout period between 10 and 30 seconds.
- *Check for private IPs and reserved IPs*. The VTN should check if users are creating subscriptions with a webhook callback URL to `http://127.0.0.1` or attempting to use URLs that resolve to private ranges. As a potential attack vector are domains that resolve to private IPs. For example, an attacker could set up `http://foo.com`> which resolves to a private IP.
- *Redirects to private IPs*. If the VTN HTTP client library follows redirects, the attacker can set up a webhook callback URL endpoint that redirects to a private IP. It is recommended that a VTN does not follow redirects.
- *Sign webhook payloads*. A VEN client may verify the source of a VTN request when a VTN signs the webhook payload with a secret key. One way to do this is symmetrically by using HMAC cryptography algorithm. The VTN signs the webhook payloads with a symmetrical secret key and sends the signature in the request header for the VEN client to verify it.
- *List the origin IPs*. A VTN may list and communicate out of band the IP origins of the sent requests to VEN clients. This information allows developers to implement IP policies in their VEN clients for additional security.
- *Error handling and backing off*. The VTN sends POST requests to VEN clients endpoints but some of them will inevitably fail (DNS issues, incorrect routing, etc.). VTN may retry to some degree, but not constantly and not forever. The general practices for handling this should be the following:
  - Use fixed delay between retries or even exponential backoff to slowly increase the time between retries.
  - If an endpoint hasn't been responding for a while, mark it as "broken" and stop sending requests to it.
  - Once an endpoint is marked as broken, send a notification (e.g., email) to the developer notifying them that the VTN has been unable to reach the endpoint and they need to fix it.

# Reference Implementation

The OpenADR Alliance provides an open source Reference Implementation (RI) [OADR3-RI] which includes a simple implementation of the client credential flow.

Using constructs available in OpenAPI and the swaggerhub auto-generated python VTN server, the RI provides an `<base_url>/auth/token` endpoint that clients use to exchange pre-allocated clientID and secret credentials for an access token. The token is included as a bearer token header in each subsequent API request. The server framework resolves the token to a set of scopes which are used to enforce access control to each endpoint operation. These steps are described below:

## Step 1: Trade clientID/clientSecret for access token

CURL is a command line tool for making http requests. The example here illustrates an http GET request to obtain an access token. ClientID and clientSecret are included as headers, per best practice.

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/openadr3/OADR-3.0.0/1.0.0/auth/token \
  -H 'clientID: ven_client' -H 'clientSecret: 999'
```

The RI hardcodes `clientIDs` and `clientSecrets` and tokens. On requests to the auth/token endpoint the endpoint handler (`fetch_token()`) interprets the `clientID` and `clientSecret` headers in the request and returns one of `'ven_token'`, `'bl_token'`, or 'bad_token'.

In a production environment, the entity that grants `clientIDs` and
`clientSecrets` populates a service or database with an association
between those credentials and a token and set of scopes, such that Step 3 below can be performed.

## Step 2: Include access token in API requests

The token obtained from Step 1 is used in a Bearer token header in API requests, as illustrated below:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/openadr3/OADR-3.0.0/1.0.0/programs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ven_token"
```

## Step 3: Resolve token to scopes

A scope is a string associated with an endpoint operation that the server framework checks to ensure an incoming request is permitted. See section above titled **OpenAPI Specification** for an example.

On every API request (except `<base_url>/auth/token`) the server framework invokes the `authorization_controller.check_oAuth2ClientCredentials()` method to resolve a token to a set of scopes.

The RI hardcodes the association between tokens and scopes.

In a production environment, the association between tokens and scopes is dynamically maintained by service or database.

## Step 4: Enforce Access Control

On every API request (except `<base_url>/auth/token`), after a token as been resolved to scopes, the server framework invokes the `authorization_controller.validate_scope_oAuth2ClientCredentials()` method to ensure the request has been granted the required scopes for the requested operation. If the required scopes have not been granted an http 403 status code will be returned.
