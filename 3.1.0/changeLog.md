# changeLog
openADR v 3.1.0

The most significant changes between versions 3.0.1 and 3.1.0 are:
- message queue notifications (issue 114) 
- object privacy (issues 272, 287, 321, 328)
- compact representation of serial data like PRICE (issue 238)
- additional reporting features (issue 271)
- simpler targeting (316, 331)
- security hardening (issues 128, 226)

3.1.0 is NOT backwards compatible with 3.0.1 as some changes to API endpoints (e.g. /resources), 
request bodies (e.g. vens and resources), and query params (e.g. targets) have been introduced
to make the interface more secure, compact, and easier to use.
